node-gn
==================
### Node.js native addon build tool with GN/Ninja.
`node-gn` is a Node.js native addon build tool using GN/Ninja, compared to
[`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) which uses [gyp](https://gyp.gsrc.io/)  as the native addon meta-build system.
Because the v8 project has already swithed to [GN](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/tools/gn/) build system since version 6.6 [related link]('https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/03/v8-release-66.html'),
using `node-gn` as the native addon build tool is a supplement to the `node-gyp` tool.

How to Install
-----------------
The npm pakcage in npm.js is [`gn-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gn-node), to install `node-gn`, you should run:
```
npm install -g gn-node
```
`node-gn` already contains builtin GN binary `gn` and Ninja binary `ninja`, so you don't have to
install GN and Ninja additionally.
